CC2020 seeks to generate a modern revision of the well-known CC2005 document by reflecting a more current view of computing, including the addition of new and emerging sub-disciplines like cybersecurity and data science. Further, CC2020 proposes a competency-based characterization of computing, as well as a bottom-up organization of computing into its sub-disciplines based on an analysis of competencies. This session imparts the results of the project to date and provides an opportunity for participants to infuse new ideas on the current computing disciplinary landscape, as well as input for the competency model it proposes.},
